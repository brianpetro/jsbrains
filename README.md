## Principles of JS Brains

### Minimal Dependency
JS Brains is designed to operate with low to no external dependencies, making it a lightweight and secure option for users. This principle ensures that the project can be easily integrated into existing systems without introducing complex dependencies that might affect performance or security.

### Web-Native and Lightweight
The project is built to be web-native, emphasizing performance and ease of use within web environments. This aligns with the goal of making the project lightweight, ensuring that it does not consume excessive resources, which is crucial for maintaining fast and responsive applications.

### Extendability
JS Brains is structured to be extendable, allowing developers to build upon the existing base to create tailored solutions that meet specific needs. This flexibility is a core principle, as it empowers developers to innovate and expand the functionality according to emerging requirements or opportunities.

### Ease of Development and Security for End-Users
The project aims to simplify the development process, making it easier for developers to implement AI into their projects. At the same time, it prioritizes minimal dependencies to maximize security for end-users, addressing potential vulnerabilities that could arise from third-party libraries.

### Mission-Oriented Design
JS Brains is mission-driven, with a clear purpose to enable JavaScript developers to build AI applications easily. This involves creating a framework that provides the necessary tools and resources while being straightforward enough for developers at various skill levels to use effectively.
