# Smart File System (SmartFs)

Smart FS is an intelligent file system wrapper designed for use with Smart Environments. It provides a layer of abstraction over Node.js's native `fs` module, adding features like automatic `.gitignore` handling and path resolution.

## Features

- Automatic `.gitignore` pattern handling
- Path resolution relative to the environment path
- Wrapping of common `fs` methods with additional smart functionality
- Support for both synchronous and asynchronous operations
