## Smart Templates

Smart Templates is a powerful and flexible system for generating content with AI, designed to streamline the process of creating dynamic, context-aware templates.

### Key Features

1. **Unstructured Input**: Unlike traditional template systems, Smart Templates can work with unstructured context, eliminating the need to specify exact values for each variable.

2. **Mini-Prompts**: Variables in templates act as mini-prompts, allowing for more nuanced and context-aware content generation.

3. **EJS Base Syntax**: Utilizes EJS (Embedded JavaScript) as the foundational template syntax engine.

4. **Global Variable Mapping**: Variables can be mapped to prompts, which are editable in settings and replaced using function calls.

5. **AI-Powered Content Generation**: Leverages AI models to generate content based on the provided context.

6. **Adapter Support**: Enables non-EJS template syntax through adapters, which convert to EJS for variable extraction and merging.

### Why Smart Templates?

- **Flexibility**: Adapts to various content generation needs with minimal setup.
- **Context-Awareness**: Generates content that's relevant to the surrounding context.
